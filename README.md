# Fruit and Vegetables Store

Welcome to the Fruits and Vegetables Store project in Hebrew! This is a full-stack application that includes a frontend, backend, and admin panel. 
The project aims to provide an online platform for users to browse and purchase various fruits and vegetables.

## Technologies Used

The following technologies were used to develop this project:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- React
- React Bootstrap
- Material-UI (Mui)
- React DOM
- Redux
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- Firebase

## Project Structure

The project is organized into three main parts: frontend, backend, and admin panel. Let's explore each part:

### Frontend

The frontend of the application is built using React, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create the user interface components and handle user interactions. React Bootstrap and Material-UI (Mui) are used to enhance the styling and provide pre-designed UI components.

### Backend

The backend is implemented using Node.js, a JavaScript runtime, and MongoDB, a NoSQL database. Node.js is used to create a server-side application that handles API requests and interacts with the database. MongoDB is employed to store and retrieve data related to fruits, vegetables, user information, and orders.

### Admin Panel

The admin panel allows authorized users to manage the inventory, including adding, updating, and deleting products. It is built using React and provides a user-friendly interface to perform these administrative tasks.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the Fruit and Vegetables Store project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from GitHub: `git clone <repository_url>`
2. Install the required dependencies for the frontend by navigating to the frontend directory and running `npm install`.
3. Similarly, install the required dependencies for the backend by navigating to the backend directory and running `npm install`.
4. Create a Firebase project and configure the necessary authentication and database settings.
5. Replace the Firebase configuration in the backend `config/firebase.js` file with your own Firebase configuration.
6. In the backend `config/keys.js` file, update the MongoDB connection URL to your own MongoDB instance.
7. Start the frontend development server by running `npm start` in the frontend directory.
8. Start the backend server by running `npm start` in the backend directory.

After completing these steps, you should have the Fruit and Vegetables Store project up and running locally on your machine.
